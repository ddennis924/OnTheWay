# OnTheWay

OnTheWay is dedicated to finding the fastest route to pick up your friends, no matter where they are. Using Google Places autocomplete, OnTheWay will find the closest address and calculate your route to pick up any friend in need on the way, and if no trip is planned, will create a route for you.

Features:

- Right click any selected address/ address tidbit to add the selected address as a stop to currently open google maps trip
- Click the to add previously saved addresses to a trip instantly in any tab
- Right click any saved addresses to remove them

SETUP: in background.js, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your Google Places API Key, and add OnTheWay as an extension in chrome extensions developer mode

Note: this project was created for fun and for convenience as my first Chrome Extension attempt, any feedback is appreciated :)
